# Star Scream
### Category: OSINT

I was born beneath a sky of frost, yet within me burns a furnace no winter could quell. 
From the instant of my shaping, return was never written. 
I crossed paths with a giant draped in shattered glass.
Now I keep strange company on the endless shore
The silence of the void is broken by faint whispers carried home.

## Difficulty
**Medium**

## Fun
Involves looking through a public repository of satellite launches and or asking some well-placed questions and scouring resultant wikipedia pages. I think it's fun because it can provide players with some interesting space-related search tools and also give a short history lesson on some countries and their space accomplishments
